# Rivals Station Reporter

Desktop app for tournament stations running Rivals of Aether II: it watches
the game's stats save + replays, reconstructs each set as it's played, and
reports live scores to your bracket — same stack and look as the
[Rivals 2 Tag Tool](https://github.com/jugeeya/rivals-2-tag-tool)
(Tauri 2 + Vue 3, Rust core).

This is the Rust rewrite of the Python station reporter that lived in
[`jugeeya.github.io/matchlogger/sender/`](https://github.com/jugeeya/jugeeya.github.io/tree/main/matchlogger/sender)
— one installer instead of a Python install, a real UI instead of a Tk
widget. The full design is in `rivals-station-reporter-architecture.md`
(kept alongside this repo).

## What each PC runs

- **Station** — a PC people play on. Watches
  `Rivals2_StatsSaveSlot.sav` + the `Replays` folder (no game mod, no
  injection), rebuilds each game/set, and forwards them to the hub with this
  station's number.
- **Operator** — the TO machine. Runs the LAN hub every station posts to and
  is the only PC that talks to start.gg (the API token never leaves it).
  Gets the all-stations console: live scores stream to the bracket
  automatically, but **naming a winner is always an explicit click** —
  nothing ever advances the bracket on its own.
- **Both** — one PC doing both jobs.

The hub speaks the same `/matchlogger/*` HTTP API as the Cloudflare broker
(`jugeeya.github.io/broker/worker.js`), so stations can point at either, and
old Python stations interoperate with a Rust hub (and vice versa) during
migration. Online/ranked ladder games are detected via the save's game mode
and never touch the bracket.

## Install

Grab the installer from the latest GitHub release (Windows NSIS `.exe`;
macOS `.dmg`). First run walks through setup: pick what this PC is, paste the
start.gg event link (it echoes back the tournament name so a wrong paste is
caught immediately), enter the shared key from whoever runs the event — done.
Save/replay paths are auto-detected.

Closing the window sends the app to the tray; reporting keeps running.
"Start with Windows" is in Settings.

An existing `config.json` from the Python reporter uses the same keys and can
be pasted into Settings field-by-field (the file lives at the app config dir
once saved).

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # UI in a plain browser — a scripted fake tournament drives it
pnpm tauri dev    # the real desktop app
cargo test -p station-core   # every ported behavior test (matching, stats,
                             # set machine, hub, forwarder, startgg client)
```

All logic lives in `crates/station-core` (no Tauri dependency) — 1:1 ports of
the Python modules with their tests. `src-tauri` is a thin shell: an engine
thread that owns the producer/forwarder/hub and pushes state to the UI over
one event.

To check save-parsing parity against a real save:

```sh
RSR_REAL_SAVE="C:/Users/you/AppData/Local/Rivals2/Saved/SaveGames/Rivals2_StatsSaveSlot.sav" \
  cargo test -p station-core parses_real_save
```

## Release

Tag `v*` and push — CI builds the installers and attaches them to a draft
release. Unsigned binaries: Windows SmartScreen will warn on first run
("More info → Run anyway").
